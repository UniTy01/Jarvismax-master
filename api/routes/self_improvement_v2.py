api/routes/self_improvement_v2.py — Extended self-improvement endpoints.

Complements api/routes/self_improvement.py with additional V2 controls.
Registered in api/main.py as self_improvement_v2_router.

      It is handled exclusively by self_improvement.py (mounted first in main.py).

Endpoints:
  GET  /api/v2/self-improvement/failures
  GET  /api/v2/self-improvement/proposals
  POST /api/v2/self-improvement/validate
