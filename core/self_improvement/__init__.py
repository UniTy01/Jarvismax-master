core/self_improvement/ — Canonical Self-Improvement Package (V3)
================================================================

CANONICAL ENTRY POINTS:
  from core.self_improvement import check_improvement_allowed
  from core.self_improvement import get_self_improvement_manager
  from core.self_improvement.engine import SelfImprovementEngine

ARCHITECTURE (V3 cycle):
  1. OBSERVE   — FailureCollector gathers runtime signals
  2. CRITIQUE  — ImprovementPlanner clusters and prioritizes
  3. GENERATE  — CandidateGenerator produces patch candidates
  4. SANDBOX   — SandboxExecutor applies patch in isolation
  5. VALIDATE  — ValidationRunner runs tests + linter
  6. PROMOTE   — PromotionPipeline applies to production or queues for review
  7. LEARN     — ImprovementMemory stores outcome for future cycles

DEAD CODE WARNING:
  core/self_improvement.py  — SHADOWED by this package, unreachable at runtime.
                              Contains legacy SelfImprovementManager.
                              Callers that need get_self_improvement_manager()
                              must import from this package (__init__.py).
  core/self_improvement_engine.py  — V2 intermediate, superseded by engine.py.
  core/self_improvement_loop.py    — V3 loop variant, partially superseded.

SAFETY CONSTANTS (anti-loop guards):
  MAX_IMPROVEMENTS_PER_RUN = 1   — never more than 1 improvement per execution
  COOLDOWN_HOURS = 24            — no improvement if last one < 24h ago
  MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES = 3   — auto-pause after 3 consecutive failures
