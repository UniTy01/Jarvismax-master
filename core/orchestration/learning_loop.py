"""
core/orchestration/learning_loop.py — Post-mission learning loop.

After each mission completes, the learning loop:
1. Reviews the reflection verdict
2. If low confidence or retry: extracts lesson
3. Feeds lesson into memory and skills
4. Over time, Jarvis learns from its own failures

Inspired by Hermes Agent's skill improvement + ARC's refinement loops.
