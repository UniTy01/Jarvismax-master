kernel/adapters/policy_adapter.py — Bridge between core PolicyEngine and kernel policy pipeline.

ARCHITECTURE RULE (Kernel Rule K1):
  kernel/ NEVER imports from core/, agents/, api/, tools/.
  This adapter uses the REGISTRATION PATTERN to break the circular dependency.

  Instead of importing core.policy_engine directly, core registers a callable
  here at boot time (via register_core_policy_fn). If no callable is registered,
  the kernel-native evaluator is used — which is always sufficient.

HOW TO REGISTER (call once at app startup, after kernel boot):
  from kernel.adapters.policy_adapter import register_core_policy_fn
  from core.policy_engine import PolicyEngine
  from config.settings import get_settings
  register_core_policy_fn(PolicyEngine(get_settings()).check_action)
