kernel/learning/learner.py — Kernel Learning Engine
=====================================================
The kernel decides when to learn, what to learn, and where to store it.

KERNEL RULE: This module does NOT import from core/, agents/, api/, tools/.
Core lesson storage (core/orchestration/learning_loop.store_lesson) registers
itself here via register_lesson_store(). If no store is registered, the kernel
logs the lesson (fail-open — never blocks mission completion).

Why this exists (Pass 10):
  Previously, core/meta_orchestrator.py called core.orchestration.learning_loop
  directly, re-deriving lesson content from raw metadata (verdict string, float
  confidence). The kernel already owned this data via KernelScore (Pass 8) but
  had no control over the learning decision.

  KernelLearner closes the cognitive loop:
    kernel.evaluate() → KernelScore → kernel.learn(score) → KernelLesson stored

Registration (at app startup — in main.py):
  kernel.learning.learner.register_lesson_store(
      core.orchestration.learning_loop.store_lesson
  )
