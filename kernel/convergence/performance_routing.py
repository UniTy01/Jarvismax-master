"""
kernel/convergence/performance_routing.py — Feed kernel performance into routing.

Conservative integration: adjusts provider reliability scores using real
execution outcomes before the existing scorer runs.

Rules:
  - Only adjusts reliability (0.0-1.0) — never overrides readiness/safety/policy
  - Uses EMA success rate as primary signal (weighted toward recent)
  - Requires minimum samples before adjusting (avoid noise)
  - Blends kernel data with existing reliability, doesn't replace
  - Degraded providers get a penalty, strong providers get a small bonus
  - All operations fail-open: if anything errors, provider keeps original reliability

Design:
  Before scoring:  enrich_providers(providers) → same list, mutated reliabilities
  After scoring:   untouched (scorer already uses reliability in weighted formula)
